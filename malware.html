				<p>What is malware?What types of malware are there? What can be done with malware? All these questions and more will be answered here.
				Malware is any form of software specifically designed to be mallicous and do something to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorized access to systems. They are usually designed by people who would like to gain money, reputation or cause mayhem.
				There are many types of malware some of which are: Pharming, Virus, Worm, Trojan Horse, Spyware, Adware. If your system gets infected with malware than a hacker can do pretty much anything they would like, they could steal personal like bank details, they could moniter web trafic
				send spam emails, host contraband data and even be used as what's called a 'zombie' computer or a proxy.A 'zombie' computer is when a hacker use your computer to send commands and hack other devices from your computer, therefore it is harder to catch them.Some typical actions of malware could be: Deleting files, scaring the user to pay a lot of money by telling them their computer has loads of viruses, locking or encrypting files so the ueser can't access them, alter permisions so people can not access data they usually would be(this is a root kit) or opening a backdoor.
				A backdoor is when a hacker will break into a system and usually not do anything else mallicous but leave a hole in the security so they can access thesystem at a later date. So what are some signs your system has malware?
				<ul>
				<li>The 'blue screen of death' on windows</li>
				<li>Slow, freezing or crashing computer</li>
				<li>Increased popups</li>
				<li>Programs opening and closing automatically</li>
				<li>Abnormal lack of storage space</li>
				<li>Emails and messages being sent without you prompting</li>
				<li>Deleted or changed files</li>
				</ul>
				If your system has some of these signs don't worry though if you have a good antivirus, it's very unlikely but to be safe run a check on your antivirus to be safe.

				<h2>The 'Iloveyou worm' 2000</h2>
				<p>The 'Iloveyou' worm was a piece of malware, that infected over ten million windows devices. It was hidden in an email with the subject 'I love you' the email also had an attachment called 'LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs' people would download the file thinking it was a genuine love letter when infact it would run code to replace files with the extensions' JPG, JPEG, VBS, VBE, JS, JSE, CSS, WSH, SCT, DOC, HTA, MP2, and MP3' with copies of itself. Therefore eventually, the computer would become not bootable.
				It was created by a 24 year old philipene university student called Onel de Guzman.He was very poor and strugled to pay for basic necesaties and created the worm intending to steal peoples login details for there internet services and then use the victims internet.The wrom used the principle that Guzman described in his university thesis. He stated that it was easy to create due to a bug in windows 95 hat would run code in email attachments when the user clicked on them. The worm was coded in microsofts visual basic language hence the .vbs file extension.
				Although it had the .vbs extension, bydefault this would not have been visible so the user would have just seen 'I love you.txt' and assumed it was legitmate.He bacame under investigation on the 5th may that year and tried to hide evidence by removing his computer from his apartment so therfore he could have not coded the worm. However, he accidentally left some disks behind which had a copy of the worm on it. Since there were no laws in the Philippines about malware at the time he was aquited of all charges.He has not been seen since he was aquited of the charges.In 2012, the Smithsonian Institution named ILOVEYOU the tenth-most virulent computer virus in history.

			<h2>Types of malware</h2>
				<h3>Pharming</h3>
					<p>Pharming is a type of attack where people redirect genuine website traffic to another fake website by installing malware onto the computer.
					This can be done via changing host files or by exploiting the dns server through software. Although a lot of pharming attacks are done on personal computers, a scarier attack that can be done is attacking the local network router. To protect from a pharming attack, there are a few things you could do:
					<ol>
					<li>Install a good antivirus</li>
					<li>Check that you are using secure web connections</li>
					<li>Enable 2fa</li>
					<li>Use a vpn</li>
					<li>Don't use the default password on your WAP</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				<h3>Virus</h3>
					<p>A computer virus ios software that is usually hidden within another piece of legitimate looking software that will produce copies of itself(like a real biological virus hence the name).
					It will then destroy the system from the inside out. For example you may pirate a game off a dodgy website and your file may be called(call_of_duty.exe) then when you run the 'game' it may seem normal and work like it is meant to but it is secretly infiltrating your system.To protect yourself and your data you can:
					<ol>
					<li>When backing up data, keep a previous copy so you don't lose too much data</li>
					<li>Use a good antivirus software</li>
					<li>Be careful with downloads</li>
					<li>Don't downlaod things off dodgy websites</li>
					<li>Stay away from pirated software</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				<h3>Worm</h3>
					<p>A worm is a piece of malware that automatically replicates itself and spreads throughout the netwrok without human help. They are very similar to viruses except they replicate. Some types of worm viruses are: Email worms, P2P worms, Net worms, IRC worms and much more. 
					<ol>
					<li>Use a good antivirus software</li>
					<li>Disabling system restore</li>
					<li>If you do have a worm on your system isolate it so it doesn't infect the whole nework</li>
					<li>Use specialized worm removal tools</li>
					<li>Don't click on pop-ups</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				<h3>Trojan Horse</h3>
					<p>A trojan horse attack is very similar to the real trojan horse where software is disguised as one thing but is actually another. It is typically hidden in email attachments ir free to play games. Similar to worms, the trojan horse may run exactly like the game or piece of software is meant to but in the background other code is running.
					Even if you close your'game' the trojan code will still be running in the background. Sometimes they could lay dormant until you open something specific like a banking app at which point it would record the details send them to the hacker then lay dormant again.
					<ol>
					<li>Don't click on links you are unsure about</li>
					<li>Use an antivirus</li>
					<li>Only download from trusted sites and providers</li>
					<li>Be careful with what websites you are accessing</li>
					<li>Don't click on pop-ups</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				<h3>Spyware</h3>
					<p>Spyware is defined as as malicious software designed to enter your computer device, gather data about you, and forward it to a third-party without your consent. However spyware can be non malicious snd juist monitor general computer usage for example use of adverts or a keylogger.
					 A keylogger is a piece of software that monitors every key-stroke you press on your keyboard.Some keylogging software is legal like those designed for when people are working from home, they would be able to check if you are actually working and typing. 
					<ol>
					<li>Be cautious when accepting cookies</li>
					<li>Install an anti-tracking browser extension</li>
					<li>Keep software up to date</li>
					<li>Nothing is actually free(they still collect data)</li>
					<li>Only download trusted apps from official app publishers</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				<h3>Adware</h3>
					<p>Adware is software that automattically displays or downloads advertisments such as pop-ups.It's used to generate profit for it's developer as they will earn money from people clicking on the advert, so if you have something that autoclicks on ads the developer will make money.
					<ol>
					<li>Use an ad-blocker</li>
					<li>Pay fpr ad-free versions of software</li>
					<li>Buy devices from trusted companies with reputable, built-in security</li>
					<li>Use an antivirus</li>
					<li>Use an adware removal software</li>
					</ol>
