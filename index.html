				<p>Welcome hacker on this website, you will find information you need to protect(or infilatrate)a network. You can find everything you need from SQL injection attacks to denial of service attacks.
				Furthermore,on this website I have supplied links to two websites I found helpful when learning networking and 'hacking'(<a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">Hack the box</a>&<a href="https://tryhackme.com/">try hack me</a>).
				So what is a hacker?A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be unavailable to them.
				But although hacking has a lot of negative connotations, there are many forms of hacking both bad & good (called red team and blue team in the IT world).When talking about hackers, there are six main types you should know about: Black hat(mallicous hacker),white hat(ethical hacker),grey hat(not mallicous but not always ethical),green hat(new & unskilled hacker),blue hat(vengeful hacker),red hat(vigilante hacker).
				Now we've covered the types of hackers in general, we will go over quickly some of the types of mallicous hackers:script kiddie(someone who is unskilled who attack systems by running pre-made scripts they found online),a cyber terrorist(An individual with a wide skill set motivated by relgous or politcal belifs),a hacktivist(an individual who wants to promote a politcal agenda by hackaing and defacing websites).
